#The CPS1 has more variance in the size of GFX ROMs. For example, SF2 loads a WORD
#of data between a group of 4 apiece, whereas Ghosts 'n Ghouls loads a byte from a
#group of 8. Group size accounts for this by explicitly declaring how many GFX ROMs
#per group to load. In the case of SF2, [4, 4, 4] indicates that there are 3 groups, 
#each making use of 4 ROMs of data. The group_collec_size dictates how many bytes to
#take from each group. In this case, each group takes 2 Bytes
